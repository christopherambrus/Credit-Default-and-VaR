Leveraged Quandl’s extensive datasets to conduct a comprehensive analysis of financial ratios, aiming to predict 
corporate default probabilities. Applied a robust suite of classification techniques—including Logistic Regression,

20-year dataset. Additionally, developed a risk metric calculator capable of determining VaR and ES for companies, 
enhancing financial risk assessment capabilities.
